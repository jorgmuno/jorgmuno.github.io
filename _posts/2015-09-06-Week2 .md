title: Second week September sixth.
---

Overall the second week of class seem pretty slow but then again all my classes started like that. All we did this past week was review the project. I would say review because I was half way through the project. I did like the way Professor Downing was going to thru every step to make it clear. I just wish he would just review the difficult steps instead of every single one. He shouldn't review the obvious ones or the ones on piazza. A little Google magic would give you the answer. 

The quizzes for the class are not hard you just have to do the readings. Right now I'm struggling through it because I'm not much of a big reader. I get distracted really easy.

What I like about professor Downing is that he leads people to start thinking outside the box or think on the spot. Also challenges them to think of the solution to a quiz question although they didn't know the answer since the beginning.

I'm still scared of getting called upon but I haven't gotten called. Yet hahaha. So far there isn't much to say of the experience in class. Feels like the first week of class. And I understand the professor going slow because people haven't settle the class yet, some were still on the wait list.
Tip Of the Week: 
[Open Source data structures book](http://opendatastructures.org/) Profesor created an open source of data strucutres book great for reviewing for interviews.
