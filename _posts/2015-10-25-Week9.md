title: Ninth week October 25th.
---

This week projects 3 was due. I can honestly says this probably is the worst project I ever messed up in. I did careless mistakes that cost us a lot of points. Well I learned that I need to start being really careful with this sort of project I have to check that I did everything correctly and can let my emotions take over me when I'm trying to turn something in.. Anyways this week we learned how to do the poor mans vector. Which was using the allocator into it. I thought that was cool. For now I am really in a love/hate relationship with c++. I hate that you have to be very specific so our user or us don't end up causing an error to our program. I feel like a every word has 2 definitions sometimes. What I love about c++ is how it is so detail you can actually be picky about it. With friend test, and creating a class inside a class is not as hard as it in java sort of. Sort of like it a lot. How about them quizzes, there was one quiz that I got all the questions wrong. I guess because its early in the morning and didn't understand what the questions was asking us to do. Overall I think the class is great and I could say this is one of the best computer science class I've taken. The atmosphere feels great in class. 

Tip Of the Week: 
[MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) Been working with MongoDb on a side porject great for when you want to have multiple user on server.
