	Iterators iterators iterators is what we learn. It seems like it is very tedious just to improve the program or make it seems better. I'm learning that this class is really a lot to paying attention to detail. You have to really think about it. Honestly it is really confusing that just means that I'm going to have to study a lot for my upcoming test in order to score a good grade on it. Over all the iterators don't seem that hard it just seems like there a lot stuff that confuses me like the lambda. Capturing seems really hard for me to understand. We had already to question and I keep on getting them wrong. Those are my fault I really don' t pay that much attention on the quizzes for some reason. I guess I got to study harder for them. To tell you the truth those question are really not that hard at all. Writing code about iterators seemed easy until what we had to talk about Friday. Which seems rally hard because of using const. I feel like it was over use a bit but I think I understand why we need them. Creating a class and iterators seems really hard especially when we have to override some operators. Object Oriented seem to be a lot about attention to detail and nothing else. Got to pay attention to what is going on and how it is happening.

Tip Of the Week: 
[Iterators](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/stl/iterators.html) Iterators in C++ I'm going to learn for the test.
