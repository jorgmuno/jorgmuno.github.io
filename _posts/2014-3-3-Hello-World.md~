title: First week August 30th.

My first Impression of this class is that it was going to be java programming with a touch of workload. This class help me decide whether to graduate in the summer or next Fall. Decided on fall to take the extra internship. Thanks for the advice proffesor Downing. 

What I really like about this class is it give alot of example of programming it seems. Assertions, UnitTest, and the other examples are really helping nunderstand how to explain what is happening to a program. I really not enjoying writing and speaking because I have a hard time explaining things properly hopefully this class will help me do that.

The thing that I dislike about this class is the random names picking. I really hate talking out loud in front class, but I understand why the professor is doing it. To help us explain better the program and think on the spot. Both of this thing I'm not good but practice will make it perfect and this class will help.
