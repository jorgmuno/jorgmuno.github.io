title: Seventh week October 11th.
---

This week was pretty calm we learn about more iterators. Ways to use them and how to use them. We also had the test. Overall I don't think it was not bad challenging and yet interesting at the same time. I felt nervous at first for some reason felt like I never taken a test like that at first. Took me about 40 min to do the first problem. I was laughing when I realized that I was doing the problem wrong and I shouludn't get nervous about it. I really enjoying the class, the grade for the project came out. I got a perfect score but I messed up and I had to resubmit so got 20 points taken away. I broke someones code although I was using out put from the generator which was weird. I started to notice I really like the way Downing tell us to go work on the program by ourselves during class it really helps alot to understand the situation. Quizzes I did bad on last quiz and that was my doing did not started hard enough for it and gto to be calm about it and mess up like 20 times. Luckily I wont make the mistake again, hopefully. Downing anology with the paintball example is the best, its original and understandable. The cheat sheet was not that helpful in program I didn't even think I used it.
