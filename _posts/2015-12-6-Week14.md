title: Last week December 21.
---

Last week of class woooh it thought it was a great time. Downing is a great professor. Luckily I'll be taking his software engineering class with him next semester. What did we learn actually we learned a lot of thing. The one thing that I thought it was intriguing and hilarious was Downing analogy to explain to a student to use the swap function was glorious. Kind of lighten up the place. Luckily I will not miss that since I will see him again next semester. This class really thought me a lot about object oriented about c++ and Java. I will say each one of them has it perks and down but man do I hate c++ because I am not a picky programmer. But just incase I really want to build a really good program that is for time and space efficiency I will definitely program C++.
The test wasn't too bad I think it was given if you studied well and payed attention in class. Had trouble with last one but overall it was too bad. Kind of like the computer test. I just think I will need scratch paper in order to scratch out my ideas that way I can write into code. I was kind of struggling with that but it wasn't too bad. Overall class was fun and great. One of the best or might be the best CS class I've taken. Thank you Downing!
